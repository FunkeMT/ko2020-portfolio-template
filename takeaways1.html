<h1>Takeaways for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge Organization</h3>

<p class="counter">
In knowledge representation, the goal has always been to collect and represent many different areas in one central location. Nowadays, we look back to many different ways to achieve such Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS). Historically, these systems have been implemented by gathering knowledge from any kind of information object, organize them into catalogs, and store them into libraries. Today, such library catalogs are moved into the digital world, namely the World Wide Web (WWW). Wikipedia is considered one of the most famous digital KOS, which is a subpart of the WWW. Natural language is the central key element for representing knowledge, whether digital or offline. Besides, one of the five main questions we should ask when knowledge is organized is the question about 'who should organize'? There will always be a tradeoff if knowledge is represented either by community experts or the domain experts. Latter tends to represent knowledge more formally while the community can represent the essence in a more end-user friendly way.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter" data-ranking="neutral">
By using the example of information management in the area of coordinating volunteers in nonprofit organizations (NPOs), Voida et al. introduced 2011 the term 'Homebrew Databases' [Voida et al. 2011]. The term is associated negatively with the process of collecting, storing, and retrieving volunteer information in multiple, distributed, not coherent, and especially alienated databases. This led to the violation of the 'Single Source of Truth' principle, which includes several problems (e.g., duplicated data, inconsistent data, maintenance overhead) and is well known from other information and software areas like Database Management or Service-Oriented Development [e.g. Pang and Szafron 2014]. Voida et al. [2011] used the term 'Homebrew Databases' also for information storage and sharing via paper, e-mail, or office applications like Word and Excel. The need for customizable database solutions is emphasized but is contrary to the costs of such enterprise software and the budget of NPOs. However, this is not only a problem of NPOs and can also be observed in profitmaking businesses where employees are not trained in the use of enterprise software or do not have time for it.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter" data-ranking="positive">
Since websites are not only accessed by humans but also by machines to offer new services like AI-supported assistants, the need for 'semantic structured data' evolved [Guha et al. 2016]. Schema.org was introduced to achieve this goald by providing one shared vocabulary. Next to search engines, personal assistants, which are integrated into the different major operating systems (OS) like macOS and Windows, make use of this specific markup. The OS crawls, e.g., websites and e-mails, to extract specific information like calendar entries, contact details, or reservations. Guha et al. [2016] provide five design decisions of Schema.org to support the success and the high adoption rate of it: to satisfy different needs, more than one <b>i) 'Syntax'</b> allows the implementation in e.g., Microdata and JSON-LD; <b>ii) 'Polymorphism'</b>, the omission of a supertype helps to reuse existing relations; it is not necessary to provide an <b>iii) 'Entity reference'</b> (URI) for most of the schemas which improve flexibility; <b>iv) 'Incremental complexity'</b> allows the use of Schema.org for complex web applications as well as small websites with less overhead; and a recurring <b>v) 'Cleanup'</b> keeps the vocabulary powerful but as small as possible.
