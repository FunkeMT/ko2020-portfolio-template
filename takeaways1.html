<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter" data-ranking="neutral">
By using the example of information management in the area of coordinating volunteers in nonprofit organizations (NPOs), Voida et al. introduced 2011 the term 'Homebrew Databases' [Voida et al. 2011]. The term is associated negatively with the process of collecting, storing, and retrieving volunteer information in multiple, distributed, and not coherent databases. This led to the violation of the 'Single Source of Truth' principle, which includes several problems (e.g., duplicated data, inconsistent data, maintenance overhead) and is well known from other information and software areas like Service-Oriented Development [Pang and Szafron 2014]. The need for customizable database solutions is emphasized but is contrary to the costs of such enterprise software and the budget of NPOs. However, this is not only a problem of NPOs and can also be observed in profitmaking businesses where employees are not skilled in using enterprise software or do not have the time for. This phenomenon is also known as 'shadow IT' [].
