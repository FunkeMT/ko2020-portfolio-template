<h1>Takeaways for Week 3</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p class="counter">
For knowledge organization, a formal representation is essential to express things in a general meaning such that collaboration on knowledge organization is possible. These representations can then be used, reused, extended, and processed by humans as well as machines. Logic serves as a domain-independent tool to also find inconsistencies in our models. First-order logic (FOL) has been proven as the best trade-off between expressivity/complexity and decidability/efficiency. Therefore, FOL has also served as a foundation for many other formalisms, e.g., Syllogism. Latter is a very restricted formalism to express everything through four basic patterns and placeholders.  However, logic formalisms are also limited by the 'Symbol Grounding Problem,' which describes the symbol projection to the real world. At some points, the symbols need to be grounded in reality.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3 data-ranking="negative">Gensler 2010</h3>

<p class="counter">
With the book 'Introduction to Logic', Gensler (2010) introduces the basic concepts about logic and especially its terms. With the help of logic, it is possible to draw conclusions regardless of whether the questions are mathematical, philosophical, or common nature (Gensler 2010]. These conclusions are based on arguments, which break the reasoning into smaller pieces. Together with the actual conclusion, the premises results in an argument, whereby the premises as a foundation for the conclusions' proof serve. The validity of an argument is not primarily based on the premises' validity, but on the conclusion, which can be drawn from the premises. Gensler (2010) describes this as a 'follow from' relationship. If we want to prove the validity of an argument, there is no need to prove the validity of the premises itself. Instead, if an argument is sound, it is also the case that the premises have to be all true as well.

<h3 data-ranking="negative">Odell 1994</h3>

<p class="counter">
In logic and many directly related fields like philosophy and linguistics, it is essential to express and describe the association between parts, sub-parts, and the whole [Odell 1994]. Beyond these theoretical fields, the expression of objects is also relevant in more applied fields, e.g. in object-oriented programming (OOP). In OOP, object relationships are essential to model the real world in software. The unified modeling language (UML) is one graphical representation to model these OOP relations and uses relations like 'aggregation', 'multiplicity' or 'composition' [c.f. Rumbaugh et al. 1999]. However, Odell (1994) describes this process also as 'composition'. The author uses three different attributes to identify different object relationships: i) configuration, ii) homeomerism, and iii) invariance. How single parts come together to one whole, the composition itself could be very different and could be conducted into a combination of these attributes and influenced by several parameters. Natural language, i.e. English, serves here as an expressive mechanism to describe compositions. Words like 'partly' or 'part of' expressively describe the relationship between the objects.
