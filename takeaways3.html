<h1>Takeaways for Week 3</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p class="counter">
For knowledge organization, a formal representation is essential to express things in a general meaning such that collaboration on knowledge organization is possible. These representations can then be used, reused, extended, and processed by humans as well as machines. Logic serves as a domain-independent tool to also find inconsistencies in our models. First-order logic (FOL) has been proven as the best trade-off between expressivity/complexity and decidability/efficiency. Therefore, FOL has also served as a foundation for many other formalisms, e.g., Syllogism. Latter is a very restricted formalism to express everything through four basic patterns and placeholders.  However, logic formalisms are also limited by the 'Symbol Grounding Problem,' which describes the symbol projection to the real world. At some points, the symbols need to be grounded in reality.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3 data-ranking="negative">Gensler 2010</h3>

<p class="counter">
With the book 'Introduction to Logic', Gensler (2010) introduces the basic concepts about logic and especially its terms. With the help of logic, it is possible to draw conclusions regardless of whether the questions are mathematical, philosophical, or common nature (Gensler 2010]. These conclusions are based on arguments, which break the reasoning into smaller pieces. Together with the actual conclusion, the premises results in an argument, whereby the premises as a foundation for the conclusions' proof serve. The validity of an argument is not primarily based on the premises' validity, but on the conclusion, which can be drawn from the premises. Gensler (2010) describes this as a 'follow from' relationship. If we want to prove the validity of an argument, there is no need to prove the validity of the premises itself. Instead, if an argument is sound, it is also the case that the premises have to be all true as well.
