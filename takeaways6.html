<h1>Takeaways for Week 6</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Relations and Rules</h3>

<p class="counter">
To organize knowledge in a formal way it is essential to represent relations and express complex rules. However, it will always be a trade-off if we try to achieve more complexity. OWL is such a language, which allows creating reasoning and relations between entities. OWL, however, and especially first-order logic on which OWL is based, is restrictive and limited in its expressiveness, such that it is still decidable and adhere to its monotonicity. If it is necessary to express more complexity, the limits of OWL are crossed and it is not decidable anymore. Answer Set Programming (ASP) tries to close this gap. ASP is a whole family of notations and methods that enables more expressive rules, in such a way that it can still be computed efficiently. The logic programming language Prolog is an example of such an ASP language, which allows to not stick to binary rules. ASP is claimed to work in a closed setting for non-monotonic reasoning. Yet, there are still some conflicts and contradictions if ASP is applied in a real-world context.

<h3>Knowledge Maintenance and Evaluation</h3>

<p class="counter">
After information was acquired and modeled in a knowledge representation, it does not mean that this knowledge model is also well-formed and especially correctly identified. To uncover mistakes and inconsistencies in such a model, different evaluation techniques evolved. Guarino and Welty (2002) introduced OntoClean, a framework to examine errors in subclass hierarchies, i.e. ontologies. OntoClean characterizes classes by assigning four meta properties: i) Rigidity, ii) Identity, iii) Unity, and iv) Dependence. After the identification process, errors can be detected by uncovering inheritance inconsistencies. Since attributes are inherited downward in the class hierarchy, each property must hold for each subclass of a particular class. However, this identification process of each attribute is not always straight-forward and is different for each particular system. Nevertheless, subclass hierarchies are the backbone of ontologies and therefore crucial that these hierarchies are soundly implemented.

<h3>Moreau and Groth 2013</h3>

<p class="counter">
The OWL ontology component PROV (provenance) is explained by Moreau and Groth (2013a) according to a real-world journalism example. Provenance can be used to keep track of i) entities, ii) their activities, and iii) the people responsible for creating the content or the journalism data, respectively [Moreau and Groth 2013b]. Firstly, provenance and its attribute 'prov:wasAttributedTo' can be used to define and especially reproduce the 'chain of responsibility' to enable holistic tracing and ensure reliability [Moreau and Groth 2013a]. Secondly, derivations through 'prov:wasDerivedFrom' ensure that licenses and acknowledgments have been complied with to apply trustworthiness. Lastly, process flows can be expressed by the abstraction of activities, to represent different operations that have been applied throughout the entity's lifecycle ('prov:Activity'). Together, these three concepts allow a traceable and comprehensive definition across real-world entities and a representation of such inside the web.

<h3>Baeza-Yates 2018</h3>

<p class="counter">
Biases are a ubiquitous problem in any domain where humans are involved. Humans are trying to find an opinion between two opposing interests. This opinion, i.e. decision, is then represented in the particular artifact. Baeza-Yates (2018) identified different kinds of biases concerning the web. The author defined 'The vicious cycle of bias on the Web' which specifies the flow of such biases and their actual origin. The 'bias-flow' starts with each individual by contributing as well as consuming data from and to the web-ecosystem—namely the self-selection and activity bias. These data are computed and used by algorithms and agents. These systems are utilizing the data as input and compute certain actions to convert or create new content—the sampling and algorithmic bias. Lastly, machines—which could be either again algorithm or smart assistant systems—but also humans likewise, are responsible for distributing and representing the data again—interaction and second-order bias. Each involved step is responsible for different kinds of issues and biases. The cycle, as well as the inter-dependencies between each bias, are responsible for a biased web. However, to decrease the existence and prevent future biases on the web, is to create awareness in the first place.
