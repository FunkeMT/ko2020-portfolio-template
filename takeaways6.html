<h1>Takeaways for Week 6</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Relations and Rules</h3>

<p class="counter">
To organize knowledge in a formal way it is essential to represent relations and express complex rules. However, it will always be a trade-off if we try to achieve more complexity. OWL is such a language, which allows creating reasoning and relations between entities. OWL, however, and especially first-order logic on which OWL is based on, is restrictive and limited in its expressiveness, such that it is still decidable and adhere to its monotonicity. If it is necessary to express more complexity, the limits of OWL are crossed and it is not decidable anymore. Answer Set Programming (ASP) tries to close this gap. ASP is a whole family of notations and methods that enables more expressive rules, in such a way that it can still be computed efficiently. The logic programming language Prolog is an example of such an ASP language, which allows to not stick to binary rules. ASP is claimed to work in a closed setting for non-monotonic reasoning. Yet, there are still some conflicts and contradictions if ASP is applied in a real-world context.

<h3>Moreau and Groth 2013</h3>

<p class="counter">
The OWL ontology component PROV (provenance) is explained by Moreau and Groth (2013a) according to a real-world journalism example. Provenance can be used to keep track of i) entities, ii) their activities, and iii) the people responsible for creating the content or the journalism data, respectively [Moreau and Groth 2013b]. Firstly, provenance and its attribute 'prov:wasAttributedTo' can be used to define and especially reproduce the 'chain of responsibility' to enable holistic tracing and ensure reliability [Moreau and Groth 2013a]. Secondly, derivations through 'prov:wasDerivedFrom' ensure that licenses and acknowledgments have been complied with to apply trustworthiness. Lastly, process flows can be expressed by the abstraction of activities, to represent different operations that have been applied throughout the entity's lifecycle ('prov:Activity'). Together, these three concepts allow a traceable and comprehensive definition across real-world entities and a representation of such inside the web.
