<h1>Takeaways for Week 2</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Resource Descriptions</h3>

<p class="counter">
The Dewey Decimal Classification system was introduced as early as 1876 to organize the massive amount of knowledge. It uses the decimal system to classify different fields of knowledge. In categorization and classification, respectively, resources get assigned to subjects in a linear, systematic way, i.e. in a hierarchical manner. However, classification is only one possible way to describe resources to make them distinguishable as well as locatable. Tagging uses individual terms from natural language to describe the meaning and content of the resource. This comes along with the problem that the same tags could be used to describe different meanings. Therefore, a controlled vocabulary would be necessary to standardize such collections and prevent ambiguity. In order to give machines access to such resource descriptions, a formal representation, i.e. formal logic and ontologies, is necessary.

<h3 data-ranking="positive">Shoham 2015</h3>

<p class="counter">
By providing the development example of the application 'Timeful' and its success, Shoham (2015) introduces the relationship of philosophy and knowledge representation according to designing and building software features [Shoham 2015]. Timeful schedules ToDos according to the users' habits. The application relies on the user's entries, which are partitioned into four categories: i) one-time ToDo's, ii) recurring ToDo's, iii) projects, and iv) events. With MI and statistic algorithms, the application recognizes the user needs and schedules these 'Intention Objects' (IO) automatically. The IOs are the result of analyzing and categorizing the whole process by using knowledge representation. However, the crucial step towards the success of this kind of application was done by applying philosophical aspects, how an individual wants to organize and complete IOs and ToDos. Philosophy, as well as knowledge representation, help to focus on and reflect actual needs next to formal software algorithms.

<h3 data-ranking="negative">Benson and Karger 2014</h3>

<p class="counter">
Most of today's web variety offers end-users possibilities to gather all kinds of information they need. If it comes to publishing their own knowledge, there are just a couple of famous platforms they offer services without the need to be a developer or a web-expert [Benson and Karger 2014]. Facebook or Wikipedia are such platforms that provide the user with an interface to add content and bring the content into a structured representation simultaneously–but only into their ecosystem. Benson and Karger (2014) introduced 'Exhibit', a framework that makes it possible for the end-user to publish their data without expert knowledge. In Exhibit, the end-user has to take care of only two parts–the presentation-layer and the data-layer. The latter are spreadsheets that brings the data into a tabular form. Together with the Exhibit JavaScript framework, the presentation-layer consists of basic HTML and offers a custom data visualization. Benson and Karger (2014) provided a comprehensive study to analyze the workflow between the end-user and Exhibit. Among other things, they found that good documentation is essential because users have performed actual unnecessary and, therefore, time-consuming steps, such as converting their spreadsheets to JSON.

<h3 data-ranking="neutral">Haas et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Haas et al. (2011) validated the Semantic Web's value by improving search engine results, which are also traditionally known as 'ten blue links', by adding improved and more relevant content to the results' preview text. In their study, the authors used existing structured data and associated metadata on the websites for their necessary extension [Haas et al. 2011]. Many websites already offer such structured data, like 'hcard', which is already widespread but often wrong implemented. This problem can be related to other studies, which have shown that it is not trivial for non-experts to implement such metadata. Evaluations of the enhanced search results showed that these results are more helpful to the users because of the improved relevance as well as their reliability. However, it should also be noted that an automatic assignment of images and other linked data does not make sense for all search results and categories and must be adjusted together with the search term and context.</p>

<h3 data-ranking="positive">Berners-Lee et al. 2001</h3>

<p class="counter">
Providing personal assistants in the form of mobile devices and software to manage all aspects of life, as by Berners-Lee et al. (2001) in a future scenario illustrated, needs websites and their semantic representations. The authors attribute three different components to the semantic web. Firstly, the actual presentation-layer must become meaningful to machines. This makes the web-content machine-readable to offer new services even without AI usage. Secondly, these semantic representations need to be available to everyone. The authors suggest decentralization because the complexity and the size of such systems are not foreseeable. This can be achieved by using the experience of knowledge representation and the application of logic. Lastly, the metaphor of ontologies is used to express formal relations between different meanings. There is still a trade-off between natural and formal language since our natural language comes with many synonyms, making it difficult for machines to gather the right information. Therefore, relations, synonyms, and taxonomies are essential for the machines to make sense of the data and create coherent relations to give the machines some kind of intelligence.
