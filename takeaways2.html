<h3>Shoham 2015</h3>

<p class="counter" data-ranking="positive">
By providing the development example of the application 'Timeful' and its success, Shoham (2015) introduces the relationship of philosophy and knowledge representation according to designing and building software features [Shoham 2015]. Timeful schedules ToDos according to the users' habits. The application relies on the user's entries, which are partitioned into four categories: i) one-time ToDo's, ii) recurring ToDo's, iii) projects, and iv) events. With MI and statistic algorithms, the application recognizes the user needs and schedules these 'Intention Objects' (IO) automatically. The IOs are the result of analyzing and categorizing the whole process by using knowledge representation. However, the crucial step towards the success of this kind of application was done by applying philosophical aspects, how an individual wants to organize and complete IOs and ToDos. Philosophy, as well as knowledge representation, help to focus on and reflect actual needs next to formal software algorithms.

<h3>Benson and Karger 2014</h3>

<p class="counter" data-ranking="negative">
Most of today's web variety offers end-users possibilities to gather all kinds of information they need. If it comes to publishing their own knowledge, there are just a couple of famous platforms they offer services without the need to be a developer or a web-expert [Benson and Karger 2014]. Facebook or Wikipedia are such platforms that provide the user with an interface to add content and bring the content into a structured representation simultaneously–but only into their ecosystem. Benson and Karger (2014) introduced 'Exhibit', a framework that makes it possible for the end-user to publish their data without expert knowledge. In Exhibit, the end-user has to take care of only two parts–the presentation-layer and the data-layer. The latter are spreadsheets that brings the data into a tabular form. Together with the Exhibit JavaScript framework, the presentation-layer consists of basic HTML and offers a custom data visualization. Benson and Karger (2014) provided a comprehensive study to analyze the workflow between the end-user and Exhibit. Among other things, they found that good documentation is essential because users have performed actual unnecessary and, therefore, time-consuming steps, such as converting their spreadsheets to JSON.
