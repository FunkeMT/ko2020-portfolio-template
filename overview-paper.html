<p>Compile here all the summaries you wrote throughout the course about the lecture topics (14 summaries) and papers (20 summaries). Optionally, you may also include content from your flash presentation, tool screenshots, poster, and short paper. You can use the style and structure indicated below, or you can be creative and come up with your own structure and style. Just make sure that all summaries are there.</p>

<p>Paste below all summaries of the lectures and papers (just the summary paragraphs; there is no need to copy their headings). Try to group them according to aspects of the course content (for example "Formal Foundations", "User Interfaces", or "Changing Knowledge"). The references are already listed at the end of this document and don't need to be repeated here. Remove these two paragraph before submission.</p>
