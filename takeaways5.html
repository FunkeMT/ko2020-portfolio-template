<h1>Takeaways for Week 5</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge Representation on the Web</h3>

<p class="counter">
By comparing a knowledge base used in the web with a knowledge base used in e.g. companies, we can identify i) openness, ii) decentralization and iii) the location independence as the main differences and also as the main accompanied problems. To achieve a knowledge organization across the web it is crucial to address these problems by structuring its contents and implementing a semantic representation. Several semantic web languages are based on RDF which tries with minimal semantics and restrictions to express knowledge in a decentralized setting such that any web-entity is abstracted as 'resource'. However, the actual relationship among these resources is not addressed by RDF. OWL instead is capable of identifying logically and theoretically sound reasonings between resources. The trade-off between formally sound definitions (i.e. with OWL) and the convenience and simplicity (i.e. with RDF) is also a temporal question. A comprehensive formal abstraction of the entire web can only be achieved by long-term solutions which are mostly uninteresting for business companies (e.g. Google) since they focus on short-term solutions. These global companies, however, are important to push the formal abstraction forward and create an actual semantic-web.

<h3>Knowledge Modeling</h3>

<p class="counter">
The knowledge of an expert is useless and can not be applied if it exists only in the expert's head. There must be a way to extract this knowledge and translate it into an effective and computable form. This gap between an expert and an actually usable knowledge base is known as 'knowledge acquisition bottleneck'. It describes the difficulties of translating the knowledge present in someone's head (the transmitter) via, i.e. natural language and of converting this information into a processable form, i.e. a database structure, by someone else (the receiver). However, there is no actual concept that can be applied to close this gap. Knowledge extraction is a process that needs to be modeled and designed by keeping a particular context in mind. Modeling knowledge is about making choices and is the actual result by addressing all individual needs and circumstances. The Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is one example that represents one particular model to define an abstraction to organize different kinds of literature and related works to create an abstraction for different individuals. Due to this creative and context related process, Clancey (1990) defined the bottleneck metaphor is misleading.
