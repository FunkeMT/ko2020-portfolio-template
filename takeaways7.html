<h1>Takeaways for Week 7</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Smart, Connected and Open Audio-Visual Content</h3>

<p class="counter">
Compared to the MultimediaN E-Culture demonstrator from Schreiber et al. (2008), which uses existing thesauri to create annotations and is mostly based on a manual process, today's research focuses on (semi)automatic processes to extract information from cultural heritage organizations. Libraries, museums, and archives are still containing much historic content, such as newspapers, 16mm films, and audio recordings on tape, which are still not digitalized. Contrary to this 'offline' content, new and already 'digital' content is created every second which needs to be archived and enriched with meta-data. To achieve a holistic cultural heritage knowledge-base, three fundamental principles have to be taken into account. Firstly, i) 'smart' AI techniques are used to extract and 'understand' the actual content of the exhibit and automatically attach it as meta-data. Latter is an important part to comprehend what kind of entities are available in such organizations. Secondly, the usage of Linked Open Data enables ii) 'connected' knowledge-bases and allows internal as well as external linking. Lastly, the usage of open-source software and open data allows an iii) 'open' access to everyone. People should be able to reuse the material to explore and create new content and tools.
