<h1>Takeaways for Week 7</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Smart, Connected and Open Audio-Visual Content</h3>

<p class="counter">
Compared to the MultimediaN E-Culture demonstrator from Schreiber et al. (2008), which uses existing thesauri to create annotations and is mostly based on a manual process, today's research focuses on (semi)automatic processes to extract information from cultural heritage organizations. Libraries, museums, and archives are still containing much historic content, such as newspapers, 16mm films, and audio recordings on tape, which are still not digitalized. Contrary to this 'offline' content, new and already 'digital' content is created every second which needs to be archived and enriched with meta-data. To achieve a holistic cultural heritage knowledge-base, three fundamental principles have to be taken into account. Firstly, i) 'smart' AI techniques are used to extract and 'understand' the actual content of the exhibit and automatically attach it as meta-data. Latter is an important part to comprehend what kind of entities are available in such organizations. Secondly, the usage of Linked Open Data enables ii) 'connected' knowledge-bases and allows internal as well as external linking. Lastly, the usage of open-source software and open data allows an iii) 'open' access to everyone. People should be able to reuse the material to explore and create new content and tools.

<h3>Semantic Fire Fighting</h3>

<p class="counter">
Machine learning techniques are nowadays widespread in industry as well as for research, to create models and predict different behaviors. However, in a 'high risk high consequent environment', as it is e.g. for firefighters, requirements for AI techniques and especially their results are different. Firefighters have on average four minutes between their operation center and they will arrive at the actual operation site. In these four minutes, it is crucial to prepare the crew for the imminent situation as much as possible. AI techniques could use previous incident reports and include history to predict the situation. However, this will not work. Despite sufficient available information and knowledge about past incidents, the environment in which the situation takes place and the situation itself will be unique and consists of unpredictable variablesâ€”especially the human factor. One approach is, to create awareness in these four minutes, about possible factors that could be taken into account and prepare the firefighter for an unexpected situation. Knowledge organization helps to collect relevant data, take the history into account, and create relations between these data to achieve such a situation awareness system.
