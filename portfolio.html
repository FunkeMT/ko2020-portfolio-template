<h1>Knowledge and Media Portfolio (replace this title with your own)</h1>

<div id="authors">
Your Name Here
</div>


<p>Compile here all the content you gathered throughout the course: lecture and paper summaries, flash presentation slide, poster, and short paper. You can use the style and structure indicated below, or you can be creative and come up with your own structure and style. Just make sure that all needed content is there and that you submit all required files in a zip package. Remove this paragraph before submission.</p>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Paste here all summaries of the lectures and papers (just the summary paragraphs; there is no need to copy their headings). Try to group them according to aspects of the course content (for example "Formal Foundations", "User Interfaces", or "Changing Knowledge"). The references are already listed at the end of this document and don't need to be repeated here.</p>

<h3>Aspect 1 (replace with own title)</h3>

<p>...</p>

<h3>Aspect 2 (replace with own title)</h3>

<p>...</p>

<h3>Aspect ... (replace with own title)</h3>

<p>...</p>


<p>Also add your flash presentation slide somewhere (or alternatively, you can write a short paragraph about it):</p>

<a href="flash-presentation-slide.svg">
<img src="flash-presentation-slide.svg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black">
</a>


<h2>Poster (replace with the title of your poster)</h2>

<p>
<a href="poster.svg">
<img src="poster.svg" alt="" style="border:1px solid black">
</a>
</p>

<!-- Use the following line instead of the above, if your poster is in PDF format:
<embed src="poster.pdf" width="100%" height="800" alt="">
-->


<h2>Short Paper (replace with the title of your short paper)</h2>

<p>Paste the content of your short paper here. Add your additional references to the references section below (you don't need to have a separate reference section).</p>
